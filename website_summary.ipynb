       "- **Definition**: A quantum computer is a model for building computers that leverage quantum properties to perform operations on data.\n",
       "- **Qubits**: Unlike classical computers that use bits (which are either on or off), quantum computers utilize **qubits**, which can represent both states simultaneously due to superposition.\n",
       "- **Rapid Progress**: Quantum computing is a relatively new field, with ongoing research supported by governments and military funding for potential applications like cryptanalysis.\n",
       "- **Comparison**: While quantum computers cannot compute functions that classical computers cannot, they can solve certain problems much faster, highlighting their potential advantage.\n",
       "- **Future Prospects**: The text emphasizes the possibility of building large-scale quantum computers that could outperform classical computers in specific tasks.\n",
